** Using provided packets because I'm doing this on a plane

1. Source IP: 192.168.1.102
   Source port: 1161

2. Dest IP: 128.119.245.12
   Dest port: 80

3. Didn't answer this because I didn't use my own trace

4. The sequence number is 0. The segment has [SYN] under 'info' which tells me
   that it is a SYN segment.

   ... this goes on and on, but this is the portion containing POST

7. First 6 segments: 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11
   Segment 1:
      Sequence #: 1
      Time sent: 0.026477 sec
      ACK: 0.053937 sec
      RTT Value: 0.02746 sec
   Segment 2:
     Sequence #: 566
     Time sent: 0.041737 sec
     ACK: 0.077294 sec
     RTT Value: 0.035557 sec
   Segment 3:
     Sequence #: 2026
     Time sent: 0.054026 sec
     ACK: 0.124085  sec
     RTT Value: 0.070059 sec
   Segment 4:
     Sequence #: 3486
     Time sent: 0.054690 sec
     ACK: 0.169118 sec
     RTT Value: 0.11443 sec
   Segment 5:
     Sequence #: 4946
     Time sent: 0.077405 sec
     ACK: 0.217299 sec
     RTT Value: 0.13989 sec
   Segment 6:
     Sequence #: 6406
     Time sent: 0.078157 sec
     ACK: 0.267802 sec
     RTT Value: 0.18964 sec

8. Segment 1: 565 bytes
   Segment 2: 1460 bytes
   Segment 3: 1460 bytes
   Segment 4: 1460 bytes
   Segment 5: 1460 bytes
   Segment 6: 1460 bytes

9. Min amount of buffer space advertised is 5840 bytes
   The lack of buffer space does not throttle the sender

10. There are no retransmissions in this trace file. Retransmissions in
    Wireshark are labelled and colored specifically, so since I don't see any
    of the color/label for retransmissions, i can say that there were none.

11. There are 12 ACKs, and each acknowledge 1460 bytes except for two: ACK 1
    acknowledges 566 byes and ACK 7 acknowledges 1147 bytes. If you look at the
    amount of acknowledged data for each ACK, you can see that there are some
    cases where the receiver is ACKing every other segment.

12. We divide the total throughput (164090 bytes) by the total time (5.4294 sec)
    164090/5.4294 = 30222.49 bytes/sec

13. Slow start begins at 0.042 sec and ends at 0.055 sec. At this point, the
    sequence number doubles and begins to grow much faster.
    Congestion avoidance begins at 0.309 sec, because the shape of the graph
    turns into 'stair steps' where sequence number and time increase at the same
    rate.

I am using IPv4 on my Mac. I know this because I have an IPv4 address under
my network preferences, but no IPv6 address.
