1. Why are Internet standards important?
------------------
Internet standards are important because they guide how information is transmitted and conveyed. It dictates the length of bits (example in class, where 4 bits were sent but the router was looking for 6). It helps ensure information isn't mis-delivered or lost. It ensures consistency and continuity across the internet, so that information from one source can be guaranteed to be compatible with another source.


2. What are the five layers of the Internet protocol stack discussed in class? 
   What are the principal responsibilities for each of these layers?
------------------
Layer 1: Physical layer. Responsible for actually transmitting the information as symbols.
Layer 2: Data Link layer. Responsible for medium access as well as reliability.
Layer 3: Network layer. Responsible for addressing and routing packets.
Layer 4: Transport layer. Responsible for end-to-end communication and chopping packets up.
Layer 7: Application layer. Responsible for providing the message/data to be sent.


3. Skype allows calls between PCs and phones. Describe the elements of the path that might connect such end-hosts.
------------------
the PC and the Phone would be two end-user nodes. Each would be connected to a router, and from there the router would communicate with other routers to reach it's destination (from Computer to phone). This channel would be reserved (circuit-switched vs packet-switched) because the communication will last for a finite amount of time and requires a certain amount of bandwidth, which circuit-switching provides and packet switching cannot.


4. Consider an application that transmits data at a steady rate (for example, the sender generates an N-bit unit of data every k time units, where k is small and fixed). Also, when such an application starts, it will continue running for a relatively long period of time. Would a packet-switched network or a circuit-switched network be more appropriate for this application? Why?
------------------
Because it's transmitting data at a steady rate and running for a long time, I would assume a circuit-switched network would be the optimal choice. This is because circuit switching allows for lower end-to-end delay, which is optimal for a steady data stream. A packet-switched network could result in data loss and is more effective for bursty data, and continuous streams of data probably aren't considered "bursty".

5. In this problem, we consider sending real-time voice from Host A to Host B over a packet-switched network (VoIP). Host A converts analog voice to a digital 64 kbps bit stream on the fly. Host A then groups the bits into 56-byte packets. There is one link between Hosts A and B; its transmission rate is 2 Mbps and its propagation delay is 10 msec. As soon as Host A gathers a packet, it sends it to Host B. As soon as Host B receives an entire packet, it converts the packet's bits to an analog signal. How much time elapses from the time a bit is created (from the original analog signal at Host A) until the bit is decoded and played back as part of the analog signal at Host B?
------------------
(56*8)/(64*10^3) = .007 *1000 = 7 msec
(56*8)*1000/(64*10^6) = .007 msec

7 msec to generate + .007 msec to transmit + 10 msec delay = 17.007 msec delay.


6. Suppose there are M disjoint paths between client and server.
Path k∈[1,M] consists of N links with capacities rk1,rk2,…,rkN
What is the achievable download rate (formula) if the client can.

A. Use one path at a time?
B. Use K paths in parallel?
------------------
A. min(r^k_1...r^k_n)

B. min(r^k_1...r^k_n)/M


7. Consider a path of L links each with loss probability p due to interference.

A. What is the probability that a packet transmitted by the client does not reach the server?
B. Assume that a client sends a message segmented into four packets. What is the probability the message will get through to the server without any retransmissions?
------------------
A. probability = 1 - (p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_L)

B. probability = 1- 4(p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_L)

A. probability = (1-p)p^L

B. probability = 4(1-p)p^L
